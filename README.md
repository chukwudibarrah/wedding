## My process

## Built with

Vite - to create the lightweight React base
React JS library
Tailwindcss - styling and mobile-first design
Firebase - handle/store the database of the RSVP form responses
Framer Motion

### Continued development

The initial idea was to build this in React but I wanted to complete it in the time I set for myself so I went the easier route. For future development, the overall interface will be improved and will be done in React with Tailwindcss
